# What the f*%# is this!?
Do you feel like a moron?
Well… you probably are. But hey, we’ve all been there — looking at a PDF and feeling like your IQ just dropped 20 points.

Lucky for you, I’ve built something that might just save your dignity.
This little program takes those scary, complicated PDF files and turns them into bite-sized flashcards you can actually learn from. Even better, it focuses extra on the stuff that gives you the most trouble — because repetition is key… and let’s be honest, we already know your brain is very smooth, so it needs plenty of practice.

So buckle up, hit start, and prepare to get smarter (or at least fake it really well).
Good luck, you stupid piece of shit
